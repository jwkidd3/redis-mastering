# Redis Streams Architecture for Claims Processing

## Overview

This document describes the event sourcing architecture implemented using Redis Streams for claims processing in the insurance domain.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Event Stream (`claims:events`)

**Purpose:** Central event log for all claim-related events  
**Key Features:**
- Immutable event storage
- Guaranteed ordering
- Automatic ID generation with timestamps
- Built-in persistence

**Event Schema:**
```json
{
  "eventId": "uuid",
  "eventType": "claim.submitted|claim.assigned|claim.approved|claim.rejected",
  "claimId": "CLM-XXXXXXXX",
  "timestamp": "ISO8601",
  "data": { /* event-specific data */ },
  "version": "1.0"
}
```

### 2. Consumer Groups

#### Processors Group
**Purpose:** Handle claim state transitions and business logic  
**Responsibilities:**
- Auto-assign claims to adjusters
- Update claim status
- Enforce business rules
- SLA management

#### Analytics Group
**Purpose:** Real-time business intelligence and metrics  
**Responsibilities:**
- Event counting and aggregation
- Performance metrics calculation
- Leaderboard updates
- Processing time analysis

#### Notifications Group
**Purpose:** Customer and stakeholder communication  
**Responsibilities:**
- Email notifications
- SMS alerts for urgent claims
- Status update notifications
- Compliance reporting

### 3. Data Models

#### Claim Snapshot Storage
- **Location:** `claim:{claimId}` (Redis Hashes)
- **Purpose:** Current state for fast lookups
- **Updated:** On each state transition event

#### Analytics Storage
- **Daily Metrics:** `analytics:daily:{date}`
- **Hourly Metrics:** `analytics:hourly:{date}:{hour}`
- **Processing Times:** `analytics:processing_times:{date}` (Sorted Sets)
- **Leaderboards:** Various sorted sets for rankings

## Event Types

### Core Events

1. **claim.submitted**
   - Initial claim creation
   - Contains full claim details
   - Triggers assignment workflow

2. **claim.assigned**
   - Claim assigned to adjuster
   - Updates workload metrics
   - Sets SLA deadlines

3. **claim.document.uploaded**
   - Supporting documents added
   - Updates claim completeness
   - May trigger review workflow

4. **claim.investigated**
   - Investigation activities
   - Progress tracking
   - Evidence collection

5. **claim.approved**
   - Final approval decision
   - Payment authorization
   - Performance metrics update

6. **claim.rejected**
   - Denial decision with reasons
   - Appeal process trigger
   - Customer notification

7. **claim.payment.initiated**
   - Payment processing started
   - Financial system integration
   - Timeline tracking

8. **claim.payment.completed**
   - Final payment confirmation
   - Claim closure
   - Customer notification

## Processing Patterns

### Event Sourcing Benefits

1. **Complete Audit Trail**
   - Every action is recorded
   - Regulatory compliance
   - Fraud investigation support

2. **Temporal Queries**
   - "What was the status at time X?"
   - Historical analysis
   - Trend identification

3. **Event Replay**
   - Debug production issues
   - Test new business logic
   - Data migration scenarios

4. **Scalable Processing**
   - Multiple consumers per group
   - Horizontal scaling
   - Load distribution

### Consumer Group Patterns

#### Competing Consumers
- Multiple instances of same consumer
- Load balancing across instances
- High availability and throughput

#### Broadcast Processing
- Multiple consumer groups
- Each group processes all events
- Different business functions

#### Parallel Processing
- Partition by claim type or region
- Independent processing streams
- Reduced contention

## Operational Considerations

### Stream Maintenance

1. **Memory Management**
   - Configure max stream length
   - Implement stream trimming
   - Archive old events

2. **Consumer Monitoring**
   - Track consumer lag
   - Monitor idle consumers
   - Detect processing failures

3. **Error Handling**
   - Dead letter queues
   - Retry mechanisms
   - Alert on failures

### Performance Optimization

1. **Batching**
   - Process multiple events together
   - Reduce Redis round trips
   - Improve throughput

2. **Caching**
   - Cache frequently accessed data
   - Reduce database queries
   - Improve response times

3. **Partitioning**
   - Split by claim type
   - Geographic distribution
   - Reduce hotspots

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Stream Health
- Stream length and growth rate
- Memory usage
- Consumer group lag

### Processing Performance
- Events per second
- Processing latency
- Error rates

### Business Metrics
- Claims processing times
- Approval rates
- Customer satisfaction

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- Event data encryption
- Access control
- Audit logging

### Compliance
- Data retention policies
- Right to deletion
- Regulatory reporting

## Disaster Recovery

### Backup Strategy
- Stream replication
- Point-in-time recovery
- Cross-region failover

### Recovery Procedures
- Consumer position recovery
- Event replay processes
- Data consistency validation

## Integration Patterns

### Microservices Integration
- Event-driven communication
- Service decoupling
- Eventual consistency

### External Systems
- Database synchronization
- Third-party notifications
- Payment system integration

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Event creation validation
- Consumer logic testing
- Error handling verification

### Integration Testing
- End-to-end workflows
- Consumer group behavior
- Recovery scenarios

### Load Testing
- High-volume event processing
- Consumer scaling
- Performance degradation

This architecture provides a robust, scalable foundation for claims processing while maintaining complete audit trails and enabling real-time analytics.
