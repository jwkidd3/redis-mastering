# Redis Production Deployment Guide for Insurance Systems

## Overview

This guide covers the essential configuration and deployment steps for running Redis in a production insurance environment, focusing on data persistence, security, and monitoring.

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Infrastructure Requirements
- [ ] Dedicated Redis server with adequate RAM (minimum 4GB recommended)
- [ ] SSD storage for persistence files
- [ ] Network security groups configured
- [ ] Backup storage location identified
- [ ] Monitoring infrastructure in place

### Security Requirements
- [ ] Authentication mechanism configured
- [ ] Network access restricted to authorized systems
- [ ] Encryption in transit configured (if required)
- [ ] Audit logging enabled
- [ ] Security monitoring in place

## Configuration Best Practices

### Memory Management
```bash
# Set appropriate memory limit
maxmemory 4gb

# Choose eviction policy for insurance data
maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru
```

### Persistence Configuration
```bash
# RDB snapshots for backup
save 900 1 300 10 60 1000

# AOF for transaction durability
appendonly yes
appendfsync everysec
```

### Security Settings
```bash
# Client timeout
timeout 300

# Connection limits
maxclients 1000

# Disable dangerous commands
rename-command FLUSHDB ""
rename-command FLUSHALL ""
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Memory usage and fragmentation
- Client connections
- Command throughput
- Slow operations
- Persistence health
- Insurance data integrity

### Alert Thresholds
- Memory usage > 80%
- Memory fragmentation > 1.5
- Slow log entries > 10/minute
- Failed connections > 5/minute
- Backup failures

## Backup Strategy

### Daily Backups
```bash
# Automated daily backup
0 2 * * * /path/to/backup-insurance-redis.sh
```

### Backup Retention
- Daily backups: 7 days
- Weekly backups: 4 weeks
- Monthly backups: 12 months

## Disaster Recovery

### Recovery Procedures
1. **Point-in-time Recovery**
   - Stop Redis service
   - Replace RDB file with backup
   - Start Redis service
   - Verify data integrity

2. **Transaction Recovery**
   - Stop Redis service
   - Replay AOF file from backup
   - Start Redis service
   - Validate transactions

## Compliance Considerations

### Insurance Industry Requirements
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Audit logging and monitoring
- Access control and authentication
- Backup and disaster recovery
- Regular security assessments

### Data Protection
- Implement appropriate data retention policies
- Ensure secure data disposal procedures
- Regular compliance audits
- Documentation of all access and changes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **High Memory Usage**
   - Check for memory leaks
   - Analyze key patterns
   - Review eviction policies

2. **Slow Performance**
   - Analyze slow log
   - Check memory fragmentation
   - Review client connection patterns

3. **Persistence Issues**
   - Verify disk space
   - Check file permissions
   - Monitor background save operations

### Emergency Procedures
- Emergency contact information
- Escalation procedures
- Recovery time objectives
- Recovery point objectives

## Performance Optimization

### Memory Optimization
- Use appropriate data structures
- Set TTL for temporary data
- Monitor memory fragmentation
- Optimize encoding settings

### Network Optimization
- Use Redis pipelining
- Implement connection pooling
- Optimize serialization
- Monitor network latency
