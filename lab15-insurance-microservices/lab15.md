## Part 1: Microservices Architecture Setup (15 minutes)

### Step 1: Environment Setup

**Important:** Connect to your assigned remote Redis host (replace with actual values provided by instructor).

```bash
# Set your Redis connection parameters
export REDIS_HOST="your-redis-host.com"  # Replace with actual host
export REDIS_PORT="6379"                  # Replace with actual port
export REDIS_PASSWORD=""                  # Replace if password required

# Test connection to remote Redis instance
redis-cli -h $REDIS_HOST -p $REDIS_PORT ping

# Start Redis with microservices configuration
docker run -d --name redis-microservices \
  -p 6379:6379 \
  -v redis-microservices-data:/data \
  redis:7-alpine redis-server \
  --appendonly yes \
  --notify-keyspace-events KEA \
  --maxmemory 256mb \
  --maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru

# Initialize project structure
npm init -y
npm install redis express cors uuid winston node-cron

# Load the microservices architecture
./scripts/setup-microservices.sh
```

### Step 2: Shared Cache Management Module

Open Visual Studio Code and create the shared cache manager:

```bash
code shared/cache/distributedCacheManager.js
```

Examine the distributed cache manager implementation:

```javascript
// This module handles cross-service caching patterns
const DistributedCacheManager = require('./shared/cache/distributedCacheManager');

// Each service will use this for coordinated caching
const cacheManager = new DistributedCacheManager({
    host: process.env.REDIS_HOST || 'localhost',
    port: process.env.REDIS_PORT || 6379,
    serviceName: 'policy-service'
});
```

## Part 2: Policy Service Implementation (10 minutes)

### Step 3: Policy Service with Cross-Service Caching

Navigate to the policy service and examine the implementation:

```bash
cd services/policy-service
code index.js
```

**Key Features:**
- Policy CRUD operations with Redis caching
- Cross-service cache invalidation
- Event publishing for policy changes
- Service health monitoring

### Step 4: Test Policy Service Integration

```bash
# Start the policy service
npm start

# Test policy operations
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/policies \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "policyNumber": "POL-2025-001",
    "customerName": "John Smith",
    "policyType": "Auto",
    "premium": 1200,
    "status": "Active"
  }'

# Verify cache entry in Redis Insight
# Check key: policy:POL-2025-001

# Test policy retrieval (should use cache)
curl http://localhost:3001/policies/POL-2025-001
```

**Observe in Redis Insight:**
- Policy data cached with TTL
- Event messages in pub/sub channels
- Service registration entries

---

## Part 3: Claims Service Integration (10 minutes)

### Step 5: Claims Service with Event-Driven Architecture

Navigate to claims service:

```bash
cd ../claims-service
code index.js
```

**Key Features:**
- Claims processing with policy validation
- Event-driven notifications to other services
- Distributed session management
- Cross-service data consistency

### Step 6: Test Claims Integration

```bash
# Start claims service in new terminal
npm start

# Create a claim linked to existing policy
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/claims \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "policyNumber": "POL-2025-001",
    "claimType": "Collision",
    "amount": 5000,
    "description": "Vehicle collision on highway",
    "incidentDate": "2025-01-15"
  }'

# Check cross-service cache invalidation
# Policy cache should be updated with claim reference
```

**Observe in Redis Insight:**
- Claims data with policy references
- Cache invalidation events between services
- Updated policy cache with claim information

---

## Part 4: Customer Service & API Gateway (10 minutes)

### Step 7: Customer Service Implementation

```bash
cd ../customer-service
npm start

# Test customer operations
curl -X POST http://localhost:3003/customers \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customerId": "CUST-001",
    "name": "John Smith",
    "email": "john.smith@email.com",
    "phone": "555-0123"
  }'
```

### Step 8: API Gateway with Service Discovery

```bash
cd ../api-gateway
npm start

# Test unified API access
curl http://localhost:3000/api/policies/POL-2025-001
curl http://localhost:3000/api/claims/by-policy/POL-2025-001
curl http://localhost:3000/api/customers/CUST-001
```

**API Gateway Features:**
- Service discovery using Redis
- Request routing and load balancing
- Distributed session management
- Cross-service authentication

---

## Part 5: Advanced Integration Patterns (5 minutes)

### Step 9: Event-Driven Workflows

Test the complete insurance workflow:

```bash
# Execute the integrated workflow script
./scripts/test-microservices-workflow.js

# This will:
# 1. Create customer
# 2. Issue policy
# 3. Submit claim
# 4. Process approval workflow
# 5. Update all related caches
```

### Step 10: Monitor Microservices Integration

**Open Redis Insight and observe:**

1. **Service Registry:**
   - `service:registry:policy-service`
   - `service:registry:claims-service`
   - `service:registry:customer-service`

2. **Cross-Service Cache Keys:**
   - `policy:*` - Policy data with claims references
   - `claims:*` - Claims data with policy links
   - `customer:*` - Customer data with policy lists

3. **Event Channels:**
   - `policy:events` - Policy lifecycle events
   - `claims:events` - Claims processing events
   - `cache:invalidation` - Cross-service cache updates

4. **Session Management:**
   - `session:*` - Distributed user sessions
   - `auth:tokens:*` - Authentication tokens

### Step 11: Performance Analysis

```bash
# Run performance analysis
./scripts/analyze-microservices-performance.js

# Check service health
curl http://localhost:3000/health
curl http://localhost:3001/health
curl http://localhost:3002/health
curl http://localhost:3003/health
```

**Monitor Key Metrics:**
- Cross-service cache hit ratios
- Event processing latency
- Service response times
- Cache invalidation effectiveness
