## Part 1: Remote RESP Protocol Fundamentals (15 minutes)

### Step 1: Understanding RESP Data Types with Remote Connection

RESP (Redis Serialization Protocol) uses 5 data types:

```
+ Simple Strings  â†’ +OK\r\n
- Errors         â†’ -ERR unknown command\r\n  
: Integers       â†’ :42\r\n
$ Bulk Strings   â†’ $5\r\nhello\r\n
* Arrays         â†’ *2\r\n$3\r\nfoo\r\n$3\r\nbar\r\n
```

**Exercise 1: Observe Protocol with Remote Instance**

Open two terminals:

Terminal 1 - Start remote monitoring:
```bash
redis-cli -h redis.training.local -p 6379 monitor
```

Terminal 2 - Execute commands on remote instance:
```bash
# Simple String response
redis-cli -h redis.training.local -p 6379 PING

# Integer response
redis-cli -h redis.training.local -p 6379 INCR counter:views

# Bulk String response
redis-cli -h redis.training.local -p 6379 GET policy:POL001

# Error response
redis-cli -h redis.training.local -p 6379 WRONGCOMMAND

# Array response
redis-cli -h redis.training.local -p 6379 MGET customer:C001 customer:C002
```

**Observe** the protocol format in Terminal 1 and note network round-trip considerations.

### Step 2: Protocol Efficiency Analysis with Network Latency

**Exercise 2: Compare Command Efficiency Over Network**

Monitor these operations and observe protocol overhead with network latency:

```bash
# Individual operations (inefficient over network)
redis-cli -h redis.training.local -p 6379 SET policy:POL001 "Life Insurance Premium"
redis-cli -h redis.training.local -p 6379 SET policy:POL002 "Auto Insurance Premium"  
redis-cli -h redis.training.local -p 6379 SET policy:POL003 "Home Insurance Premium"

# Batch operations (efficient over network)
redis-cli -h redis.training.local -p 6379 MSET policy:POL004 "Health Insurance" policy:POL005 "Travel Insurance" policy:POL006 "Business Insurance"

# Pipeline demonstration (network optimized)
echo -e "SET pipeline:1 value1\nSET pipeline:2 value2\nSET pipeline:3 value3" | redis-cli -h redis.training.local -p 6379 --pipe
```

**Question:** How does network latency affect protocol efficiency differently than localhost?

## Part 2: Redis Insight Remote CLI Integration (15 minutes)

### Step 3: Configuring Redis Insight for Remote Connection

**Exercise 3: Remote Redis Insight Setup**

1. Open Redis Insight: `http://localhost:8001`
2. Click **"Add Database"**
3. Configure remote connection:
   - **Host:** redis.training.local
   - **Port:** 6379
   - **Database Alias:** Training Redis
4. Test connection and verify green status
5. Navigate to the **CLI** tab for remote command interface

**Exercise 4: Advanced Protocol Analysis with Remote Redis Insight CLI**

Execute these commands in Redis Insight CLI connected to remote instance:

```bash
# Load sample business data on remote instance
HMSET company:ACME001 
  name "ACME Corporation" 
  industry "Technology" 
  employees 5000 
  revenue 500000000
  founded 1995

# Observe hash field operations
HGET company:ACME001 name
HMGET company:ACME001 industry employees
HGETALL company:ACME001

# Monitor list operations
LPUSH recent:claims CLM001 CLM002 CLM003
LRANGE recent:claims 0 -1
LPOP recent:claims
```

**Exercise 5: Remote Protocol Monitoring in Redis Insight**

1. In Redis Insight, open the **Profiler** tool
2. Enable profiling to capture remote commands
3. Execute business operations on remote instance:

```bash
# Customer management operations
SET customer:C001 "John Doe, Age: 35, Location: Texas"
SET customer:C002 "Jane Smith, Age: 28, Location: California"  
INCR metrics:total_customers
EXPIRE customer:C001 3600

# Policy operations
ZADD policies:by_premium 1200.50 "POL001:Auto"
ZADD policies:by_premium 2500.00 "POL002:Home"
ZADD policies:by_premium 750.25 "POL003:Life"
ZRANGE policies:by_premium 0 -1 WITHSCORES
```

4. Review captured remote commands in the Profiler
5. Analyze network efficiency patterns

### Step 4: Remote Protocol Debugging Techniques

**Exercise 6: Error Handling with Remote Connection**

Use Redis Insight CLI to investigate protocol errors on remote instance:

```bash
# Network-related error testing
WRONGCOMMAND test
SET 
GET nonexistent:key
INCR string:value:key
ZADD incomplete_command

# Test connection stability
CLIENT LIST
CLIENT SETNAME "Lab2:ProtocolAnalysis"
CLIENT GETNAME
```

**Observe** error responses and network behavior differences.

## Part 3: Network-Optimized Performance Analysis (15 minutes)

### Step 5: Remote Pipeline vs Individual Commands

**Exercise 7: Network Performance Comparison**

Create a performance test with remote connection:

```bash
# Load test data script for remote instance
./scripts/load-business-data-remote.sh

# Monitor individual commands (slow over network)
redis-cli -h redis.training.local -p 6379 monitor &
MONITOR_PID=$!

# Execute individual commands
for i in {1..100}; do
  redis-cli -h redis.training.local -p 6379 SET test:individual:$i "value$i" > /dev/null
done

kill $MONITOR_PID
```

Now test remote pipelining:

```bash
# Create pipeline commands for remote execution
for i in {1..100}; do
  echo "SET test:pipeline:$i value$i"
done | redis-cli -h redis.training.local -p 6379 --pipe
```

**Question:** How significant is the network performance difference?

### Step 6: Remote Memory and Network Optimization

**Exercise 8: Protocol Overhead Analysis with Remote Instance**

Use Redis Insight to analyze remote memory usage:

```bash
# Compare storage efficiency over network
redis-cli -h redis.training.local -p 6379 SET compact:data "short"
redis-cli -h redis.training.local -p 6379 SET verbose:data "This is a much longer string that takes more space and bandwidth"

# Check remote memory usage in Redis Insight
redis-cli -h redis.training.local -p 6379 INFO memory

# Use Redis Insight's memory analysis tool for remote instance
```

**Exercise 9: Batch Operations for Remote Business Data**

```bash
# Inefficient: Multiple network round trips
redis-cli -h redis.training.local -p 6379 HSET customer:C001 name "John Doe"
redis-cli -h redis.training.local -p 6379 HSET customer:C001 age 35
redis-cli -h redis.training.local -p 6379 HSET customer:C001 location "Texas"
redis-cli -h redis.training.local -p 6379 HSET customer:C001 policy_count 3

# Efficient: Single network operation
redis-cli -h redis.training.local -p 6379 HMSET customer:C002 name "Jane Smith" age 28 location "California" policy_count 2

# Use Redis Insight to compare remote protocol efficiency
```

### Step 7: Remote Real-Time Monitoring Setup

**Exercise 10: Production-Style Remote Monitoring**

Set up monitoring for remote business operations:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Real-time remote monitoring
redis-cli -h redis.training.local -p 6379 monitor

# Terminal 2: Simulate business load on remote instance  
./scripts/simulate-business-load-remote.sh

# Terminal 3: Redis Insight - use CLI and Profiler for remote analysis
```

**Observe:**
- Network latency impact on command patterns
- Remote connection stability
- Protocol overhead in distributed scenarios

## Part 4: Advanced Remote Debugging and Troubleshooting (10 minutes)

### Step 8: Remote Connection Analysis

**Exercise 11: Client Connection Debugging for Remote Instance**

```bash
# Monitor remote client connections
redis-cli -h redis.training.local -p 6379 CLIENT LIST

# Set client name for remote tracking
redis-cli -h redis.training.local -p 6379 CLIENT SETNAME "BusinessApp:PolicyService:Lab2"

# Monitor specific remote client activity
redis-cli -h redis.training.local -p 6379 CLIENT LIST | grep PolicyService

# Check remote connection statistics
redis-cli -h redis.training.local -p 6379 INFO clients
```

### Step 9: Remote Slow Query Analysis

**Exercise 12: Performance Troubleshooting on Remote Instance**

```bash
# Enable slow log on remote instance (commands taking >10ms)
redis-cli -h redis.training.local -p 6379 CONFIG SET slowlog-log-slower-than 10000

# Execute some operations on remote instance
redis-cli -h redis.training.local -p 6379 DEBUG SLEEP 0.1

# Check remote slow query log
redis-cli -h redis.training.local -p 6379 SLOWLOG GET 10

# Reset remote slow log
redis-cli -h redis.training.local -p 6379 SLOWLOG RESET
```

### Step 10: Remote Protocol-Level Debugging

**Exercise 13: Raw Protocol Inspection for Remote Connection**

Test raw protocol with remote instance using telnet:

```bash
# Connect via telnet to remote instance
telnet redis.training.local 6379

# Type raw RESP commands:
*2
$4
PING
$0


*3
$3
SET
$8
testkey
$9
testvalue
```

**Expected raw responses:**
```
+PONG
+OK
```
