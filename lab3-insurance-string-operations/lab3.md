## Part 1: Policy Number Management & Generation (15 minutes)

### Step 1: Environment Setup with Insurance Data

```bash
# Start Redis with optimized configuration for insurance workloads
docker run -d --name redis-insurance-lab3 \
  -p 6379:6379 \
  -v $(pwd)/sample-data:/data \
  redis:7-alpine redis-server --maxmemory 512mb --maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru

# Verify connection
redis-cli ping

# Load insurance sample data
./scripts/load-insurance-string-data.sh
```

### Step 2: Policy Number Generation System

Insurance companies require structured policy numbers for tracking and compliance:

```redis
# Connect to Redis CLI
redis-cli

# Policy number generation with atomic counters
SET policy:counter:auto 100000
SET policy:counter:home 200000
SET policy:counter:life 300000

# Generate new policy numbers atomically
INCR policy:counter:auto
INCR policy:counter:home
INCR policy:counter:life

# Format policy numbers with prefixes
SET policy:last_auto_number "AUTO-100001"
SET policy:last_home_number "HOME-200001"
SET policy:last_life_number "LIFE-300001"

# Verify policy number generation
GET policy:counter:auto
GET policy:last_auto_number
```

### Step 3: Policy Data Storage and Retrieval

```redis
# Store comprehensive policy information
SET policy:AUTO-100001 "Policy Type: Auto | Customer: CUST001 | Vehicle: 2020 Toyota Camry | Premium: $1,200 | Status: Active | Issue Date: 2024-08-18"

SET policy:HOME-200001 "Policy Type: Home | Customer: CUST002 | Property: 123 Main St, Dallas TX | Premium: $800 | Status: Active | Issue Date: 2024-08-18"

SET policy:LIFE-300001 "Policy Type: Life | Customer: CUST003 | Coverage: $500,000 Term 20Y | Premium: $420 | Status: Active | Issue Date: 2024-08-18"

# Policy information extraction
GET policy:AUTO-100001
STRLEN policy:AUTO-100001

# Check policy existence for customer service
EXISTS policy:AUTO-100001
EXISTS policy:AUTO-999999

# Policy type verification
TYPE policy:AUTO-100001
```

### Step 4: Policy Number Validation and Lookup

```redis
# Pattern-based policy lookup
KEYS policy:AUTO-*
KEYS policy:HOME-*
KEYS policy:LIFE-*

# Validate policy number format (production would use SCAN)
KEYS policy:*-100001

# Policy status checking
SET policy:AUTO-100001:status "ACTIVE"
SET policy:HOME-200001:status "SUSPENDED"
SET policy:LIFE-300001:status "PENDING_REVIEW"

# Retrieve policy status
GET policy:AUTO-100001:status
MGET policy:AUTO-100001:status policy:HOME-200001:status policy:LIFE-300001:status
```

**Business Context:**
- Policy numbers must be unique and sequential for audit compliance
- Atomic increments prevent duplicate policy numbers in concurrent environments
- Structured storage enables efficient customer service lookups

## Part 2: Premium Calculations and Financial Operations (15 minutes)

### Step 1: Premium Storage and Atomic Updates

```redis
# Initial premium setup for policies
SET premium:AUTO-100001 1200
SET premium:HOME-200001 800
SET premium:LIFE-300001 420

# Customer payment tracking
SET customer:CUST001:balance 0
SET customer:CUST002:balance 0
SET customer:CUST003:balance 0

# Premium adjustments based on risk assessment
INCRBY premium:AUTO-100001 150    # Increased due to traffic violations
DECRBY premium:HOME-200001 50     # Discount for security system
INCRBY premium:LIFE-300001 25     # Age adjustment

# Verify premium updates
MGET premium:AUTO-100001 premium:HOME-200001 premium:LIFE-300001
```

### Step 2: Payment Processing and Balance Management

```redis
# Customer premium payments (atomic operations prevent race conditions)
INCRBY customer:CUST001:balance 1350    # Auto premium payment
INCRBY customer:CUST002:balance 750     # Home premium payment
INCRBY customer:CUST003:balance 445     # Life premium payment

# Calculate outstanding balances
GET customer:CUST001:balance
GET premium:AUTO-100001

# Payment verification for customer CUST001
SET customer:CUST001:paid_amount 1350
SET customer:CUST001:owed_amount 1350
GET customer:CUST001:paid_amount
GET customer:CUST001:owed_amount

# Mark payment status
SET payment:AUTO-100001:status "PAID"

INCRBY revenue:daily:2024-08-18 1350    # Auto premium collected
INCRBY revenue:daily:2024-08-18 750     # Home premium collected
INCRBY revenue:daily:2024-08-18 445     # Life premium collected

# Check daily totals
GET revenue:daily:2024-08-18

# Monthly revenue accumulation
SET revenue:monthly:2024-08 0
INCRBY revenue:monthly:2024-08 2545     # Add daily total

# Premium type breakdown
SET revenue:auto:2024-08-18 0
SET revenue:home:2024-08-18 0
SET revenue:life:2024-08-18 0

INCRBY revenue:auto:2024-08-18 1350
INCRBY revenue:home:2024-08-18 750
INCRBY revenue:life:2024-08-18 445

# View breakdown
MGET revenue:auto:2024-08-18 revenue:home:2024-08-18 revenue:life:2024-08-18
```

### Step 4: Claims Impact on Premiums

```redis
# Claims affecting future premiums
SET claims:impact:AUTO-100001 0
INCRBY claims:impact:AUTO-100001 200    # First claim impact
INCRBY claims:impact:AUTO-100001 150    # Second claim impact

# Calculate adjusted premium for renewal
GET premium:AUTO-100001
GET claims:impact:AUTO-100001

# Premium adjustment for next term
SET premium:AUTO-100001:next_term 1500
INCRBY premium:AUTO-100001:next_term 350    # Claims adjustment

GET premium:AUTO-100001:next_term
```

**Business Context:**
- Atomic operations ensure financial data consistency under concurrent load
- Separate tracking of payments, balances, and adjustments aids audit compliance
- Daily and monthly metrics support business intelligence and reporting

## üèÜ Challenge Exercises (Optional - if time permits)

### Challenge 1: Advanced Policy Number System

Implement a sophisticated policy numbering system with validation:

```redis
# Policy number with check digits and location codes
SET location:code:dallas "DAL"
SET location:code:houston "HOU"
SET location:code:austin "AUS"

# Generate location-specific policy numbers
INCR counter:policy:DAL:auto
INCR counter:policy:HOU:home
INCR counter:policy:AUS:life

# Format: LOC-TYPE-NNNNNN-C (location-type-number-checkdigit)
SET policy:DAL-AUTO-100001-7 "Auto Policy issued in Dallas office"
SET policy:HOU-HOME-200001-3 "Home Policy issued in Houston office"
SET policy:AUS-LIFE-300001-9 "Life Policy issued in Austin office"

# Validation lookup
EXISTS policy:DAL-AUTO-100001-7
KEYS policy:DAL-*
KEYS policy:*-AUTO-*
```

### Challenge 2: Dynamic Premium Calculation System

```redis
# Base rates by policy type and location
SET rate:base:auto:DAL 800
SET rate:base:home:DAL 600
SET rate:base:life:DAL 300

# Risk multipliers
SET multiplier:age:25-35 1.0
SET multiplier:age:36-45 1.1
SET multiplier:age:46-55 1.2

# Calculate premium for new customer
GET rate:base:auto:DAL
GET multiplier:age:36-45

# Manual calculation demo (in real app, this would be done in application code)
SET temp:calc:base 800
SET temp:calc:multiplier 110  # 1.1 * 100 for integer math
# Premium = base * multiplier / 100
SET calculated:premium:AUTO-100002 880

GET calculated:premium:AUTO-100002
```

### Challenge 3: Customer Communication Automation

```redis
# Template storage
SET template:renewal:email "Dear {customer_name}, Your policy {policy_number} is due for renewal. Current premium: ${premium}. Please contact us to renew."

SET template:payment:reminder "Dear {customer_name}, Your payment of ${amount} for policy {policy_number} is overdue. Please remit payment immediately."

# Customer communication queue
LPUSH comm:queue:email "CUST001:renewal:AUTO-100001"
LPUSH comm:queue:email "CUST002:payment:HOME-200001"

# Communication status tracking
SET comm:status:CUST001:renewal "pending"
SET comm:status:CUST002:payment "pending"

# Process communication queue
RPOP comm:queue:email
SET comm:status:CUST001:renewal "sent"
APPEND activity:CUST001:log "2024-08-18T15:00:00Z - Renewal notice sent\n"
```
