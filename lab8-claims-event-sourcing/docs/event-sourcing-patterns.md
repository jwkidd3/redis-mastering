# Event Sourcing Patterns with Redis Streams

## Core Concepts

### Event Sourcing
Event sourcing ensures that all changes to application state are stored as a sequence of events. Instead of storing current state, we store the events that led to that state.

### Benefits for Claims Processing
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of claim changes
- **Replayability**: Reconstruct claim state at any point
- **Debugging**: See exactly what happened and when
- **Compliance**: Meet regulatory requirements for record keeping

## Implementation Patterns

### 1. Event Structure
```javascript
{
  type: 'claim_submitted',
  claim_id: 'CLM-12345',
  customer_id: 'CUST-001',
  timestamp: '2024-08-20T10:30:00Z',
  amount: '5000',
  // ... other event data
}
```

### 2. Stream Naming
- `claims:events` - Main claim events
- `claims:failed` - Failed processing events
- `claims:analytics` - Aggregated metrics

### 3. Consumer Groups
- `claims-processors` - Main processing group
- `claims-analytics` - Analytics consumers
- `claims-notifications` - Notification senders

## Best Practices

### Event Design
1. **Immutable**: Events never change once created
2. **Self-contained**: Include all necessary data
3. **Versioned**: Handle schema evolution
4. **Timestamped**: Always include event time

### Stream Management
1. **Partitioning**: Use consistent claim IDs
2. **Retention**: Set appropriate TTL policies
3. **Monitoring**: Track stream length and consumer lag
4. **Scaling**: Add consumers to handle load

### Error Handling
1. **Dead Letter Queues**: Handle failed processing
2. **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for failures
3. **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascade failures
4. **Monitoring**: Alert on error rates

## Advanced Patterns

### Event Replay
```redis
# Replay events from specific time
XREAD STREAMS claims:events 1692531000000-0

# Replay all events for claim
# Filter by claim_id in application code
```

### Snapshot Creation
Periodically create snapshots of current state to avoid replaying entire history.

### CQRS Integration
Separate command (write) and query (read) models for optimal performance.

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Key Metrics
- Events per second
- Consumer lag
- Processing time
- Error rates
- Stream length

### Redis Commands for Monitoring
```redis
XINFO STREAM claims:events
XINFO CONSUMERS claims:events claims-processors
XPENDING claims:events claims-processors
```

## Performance Considerations

### Stream Sizing
- Monitor memory usage with `INFO memory`
- Set `maxmemory` and `maxmemory-policy`
- Consider stream trimming with `XTRIM`

### Consumer Scaling
- Add consumers during high load
- Use consumer groups for load distribution
- Monitor pending message counts

### Network Optimization
- Batch reads with `COUNT` parameter
- Use `BLOCK` for efficient waiting
- Minimize round trips
